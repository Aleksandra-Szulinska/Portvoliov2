    <h3>UFO News Page</h3>
    <p>I recently completed a project with the help of AI. I used HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to create a news page that features the latest UFO-related news. <br><br> My main focus was on creating a layout that works well on larger screens, providing easy navigation and readability. <br><br><br>Handling large sets of data presented a challenge, but I was able to manage them effectively. I incorporated multiple CSS features to ensure an easy and enjoyable reading experience.</p>

    <h3>Organisation Space</h3>
    <p>The organizational space was built with the intention of being user-friendly on mobile phones.<br><br> It was designed based on my personal needs, which I believe will also be useful for many others. The layout features four options and a transparent design, and a personalisation option, which makes it easy to access everything in one place. This project is built using Javascript and has the ability to save data on HTML inner storage, ensuring all your information is stored safely. Additionally, the sheet is password-protected for your convenience.</p>

    <div class="lineDetail"></div>
    <p>I was born in Poland but raised in England. I love exploring and experiencing new things, which is why I moved to Greece to enjoy the sun. Nowadays, I am based in Edinburgh, Scotland.<br>
        I always had the need to explore, learn and create.<br><br>

        I have always had a passion for computer systems and have used various programs while working in different industries. Seeing how technology can help both businesses and individuals in their daily life amazes me. I am particularly fond of creative work and have some experience in website building using tools like Wix. After some research, I decided to pursue UX design. To start, I wanted to understand the basics of coding to improve my design skills. So, I started learning to code and program.
        
        <br><br>Now, after taking courses and working on personal projects, I am confident in using HTML & CSS and continuously improving my JavaScript skills. My natural ability to solve problems has helped me a lot while working with code. It can be challenging at times, but the sense of accomplishment I feel when I finally solve an issue is incredibly rewarding.<br><br> I find it fascinating to see how anything and everything can be created with code.
        
        <br><br>Apart from my coding skills, I believe that my easy-going nature, excellent communication skills, and ability to collaborate with others make me an asset to any team. I have learned the importance of these skills from my previous customer-facing roles, corporate teamwork, team management, and collaboration with other sectors. I pride myself on my strategic thinking, flexibility, and ability to adapt to new tasks easily, always thinking outside the box to provide the best solutions.</p>
